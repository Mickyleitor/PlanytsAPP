## Feel and go deeper in your travels

PlanytsAPP is a Scored and Social Base App which connects a potential traveller to a local expert.  
An independent solution for the web-based site [Planyts](http://www.planyts.com/)

Experience through a deep-city is something that isn't always given by conventional Travel Agencies.  
We found this isn't covered by regular solutions like Airbnb or TripAdvisor.  
Users could search local expert, design the experience and finally score it in order to obtain popularity.

### Initial Idea

An [initial approach](https://github.com/Mickyleitor/PlanytsAPP/blob/master/docs/FirstApproach/README.md) for the app should be a simply chat traveller-expert. User should be able to search a city and display available local expert. The search engine approach could be like Airbnb (though it offers differents services or not completely focused on)

Project will be done with well-known [App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu) as it's designed for non-friendly App developers.

## Feel and go deeper in your travels

PlanytsAPP is a Scored and Social Base App which aims to help in the planning proccess of a trip by connecting the traveller to a local expert.  
An independent solution for the web-based site [Planyts](http://www.planyts.com/)

Experience through a deep-city is something that isn't always given by conventional Travel Agencies.  
We found this isn't covered by regular solutions like Airbnb or TripAdvisor.  
Users could search local expert, design the experience and finally score it in order to obtain popularity.

A PDF version have been created for presentations [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mickyleitor/PlanytsAPP/master/docs/Planyts.pdf)

### Development Phases

Phase 1 - User Requirements & Prototype
* [x] Requirement Analysis (Knowing our users, User Evaluation Feedback on the idea)
* [x] Prototype App using User Centered Design & Heuristic Evaluations
* [x] User feedback on the prototype (Controlled Experiments (ANOVA) & Interviews)
* [x] Final prototype

Phase 2 - Technical Development
* [ ] Technical implementation of the prototype
* [ ] First Minimum Viable Product
* [ ] Technical issues and feedback solving (several iterations)
* [ ] Final product and release

Phase 3 - Market & Business
* [ ] Generate Technical and User documents
* [ ] Store release and startup procedures


### Prototype Idea

After some re-design and using UCD and User Evaluation feedback, the prototype will be a simply chat traveller-expert. User should be able to search a city and display available local expert. The search engine approach is like Airbnb (though it offers differents services or not completely focused on)

Project will be done with well-known [App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu) as it's designed for non-friendly App developers.

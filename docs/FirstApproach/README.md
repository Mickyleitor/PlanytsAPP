# Initial idea and Mockup

* As a proof of concept, the application should have a search engine and a personalized chat.
* User can search for a city and see avaliable local experts showing basic data.
* Even a designer would have the option to search for on-going travellers to a city.
* Once contacted with local expert, there will be an itinerary-style showing all confirmed route.
* Travellers and Designers would have a profile page with its own planned or done experiences.
* The settings and configuration can be accessed via home panel, showing conventional settings.

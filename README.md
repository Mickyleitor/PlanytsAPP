## Feel and go deeper in your travels

PlanytsAPP is a Scored and Social Base App which connects a potential traveller to a local expert.  
Experience and deeper travel through a city is something that isn't always given by conventional Travel Agencies.  
We found this isn't covered by regular solutions like Airbnb or TripAdvisor.
